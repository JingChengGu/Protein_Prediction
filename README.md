- **Description**: In our baseline model, there are 6 predictor features, **'calories'** (quantitative continuous), **'total_fat'** (quantitative continuous), **'sugar'** (quantitative continuous), **'sodium'** (quantitative continuous), **'saturated fat'** (quantitative continuous), and **'carbs'** (quantitative continuous). For this baseline model, we did not have categorical features so no encoding or categorical transformation was done on our given features. We kept our quantitative continuous features as raw integer values. In all, we use 'calories', 'total_fat', 'sugar', 'sodium', 'saturated fat', and 'carbs' as features of our baseline Linear Regression Prediction model.
